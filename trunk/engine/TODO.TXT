(Yoseph) - reverse sequence 
- random projections :
	input: weights & sequences
	output: what are the seeds/motifs

	currently: hard-threshold for sequences for positively labeled
		finds all the features in the positive sequence
		puts random projection. keeps the k-best.
		
		works with a parameterized length of motives,
		number of projections position, number of randomizations

	future: 
(Yoseph) 1) real counts: count the weights
2) total-counts/gene counts
	total counts - prevent overlaps (or math fix later on)
	(YTD) gene counts	- option to have at least k positions in gene to count it

3) N in sequence : do not allow more than k- N in a KMer
		(does not allow any N's in a KNER)
(Yoseph) 4) statistical fix for score

random projections :
go down the tree until there is no more than k sequences (gene counts)from positively labeled
	(impossible)
K positions (total counts)

strategy:  K best / score less than: (both)

* if two motifs are the same in all no-random poisition - keep the best
* offset similarity (redundancy) - 

* exhaustive random projections
* dont allow random projections to be in outer positions

* score function doesnt have to hyper-geometric
	descend/dont descend is dependant on score
	* descend if p-value is low enough
	* descend if motif exists in 10% of sequences in the cluster



stat fix:
Bonneferoni
FDR
